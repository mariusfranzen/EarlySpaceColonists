After many years of playing rimworld, I felt like the start is a bit slow. So I made this mod which fixes that!

FEATURES:
* New faction and scenario! The Early Spacer Colonists. Starts with some more research, and they come prepared, with more building materials, better weapons, and more!

* Compatible with many mods, including:
    
	* Dubs Bad Hygiene
	
	* Vanilla Expanded and all their expansions
	
	* Expanded Prosthetics and Organ Engineering
	
	* And many more...

If you encounter any bugs, please comment and tell me, and I will fix them as soon as I can.
The same thing goes for mod compatability.
If you have any other suggestions, please share!
